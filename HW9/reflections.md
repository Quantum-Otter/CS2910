I am unsure what vunerabilities exist in my program, as I do not know about Web sockets and how they operate. My guess would be there are injection vulnerabilities somewhere, but I cannot know for sure as it does not appear at a first glance to run any javascript code, given I am using textContent and not innerHTML or alike attributes. There might be some way to intercept the data being sent over the socket, but I can't know for sure.


This exercise I learned how to create, and use web sockets to communicate to a servrer, and handle the two way communication utilized by web sockets
