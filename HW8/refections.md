Some of the things I learned during this tutorial, is how first hand to create and modify props in react, and how to use them to make a mode modular page

I enjoyed using React as it made intuitive senese to me with how all the components interacted. This might just be because of the tutorial, either way I feel like the app made sense. 

I disliked having to figure out all of the instillation stuff on my own, however once it was set it wasn't too bad.
