Some of the things I learned during this tutorial, is how first hand to create and modify props in react, and how to use them to make a mode modular page

I enjoyed using React as it made intuitive senese to me with how all the components interacted. This might just be because of the tutorial doing a good job at explaining things, rather than just giving you code, either way I feel like the app made sense. The app also made sense to develop, and how to pass data between components with parent/child relationships

I disliked having to figure out all of the instillation stuff for the dependancies, but that was partially windows being windows. I *really* ended up disliking the fact that in order to recieve props, you must have nested functions. It feels like a work around to not have classes, when I would prefer that approach. I also did not like the way react was set up within components, and how it forced functions and variable declarations to be intercut with eachother. Maybe this is just my brain, but I dislike the format of setting variables -> definig functions -> setting more variables. I would much prefer to have definitions consistent within themselves. This also might be able to be solved with smart problem solving in the order you write your code, however the fact that variables and functions both have the potential to depend on the other is an issue I take with the framework, as it makes code less readable
